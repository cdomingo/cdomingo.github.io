Hello! My name is Carl, although you could have already guessed that. I love to make video games and mobile apps. Usually, you'll find me talking about some cool tech I've found, whether it be from the main stage of WWDC or the deep underbelly of Reddit. Sometimes, I'll speak about some cool tricks that I discovered to use in code. Once in a while, you might find a gem of insight that can help you take life by the reins, if you haven't done so already.

Aside from that, I am a fairly unaccomplished Ukulele player. Yes, I can play Somewhere Over the Rainbow. I also love to play Ultimate Frisbee, because it's a great way to exercise and have fun doing it. At RIT, I give tours for Undergraduate Admissions and have the rare ability to walk backwards for a WHOLE hour.

If you like what you see, I suggest checking back weekly to see what crazy concoctions I've come up with. Any questions, comments, or concerns? Feel free to shoot me an e-mail!
