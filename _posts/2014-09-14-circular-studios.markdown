Hello again!

With the start of the year, [Circular Studios][circular] has started ramping up development again. You can find blogs from devs [Colden][colden] and [Dan][dan] about the vision of Circular and some major features of our Dash Engine. They're great starting points to learn what we're about and what we do.

We'll be going heavily into finishing and polishing our game Spectral Robot Task Force. Our engine for the most part is done, at least to a point where we can use it. We started on the game last semester and reached a good alpha stage. We actually demoed it at our school's major innovation festival, Imagine RIT, last year. We had a lot of good feedback, and people seemed really interested in our game and the engine.

This semester is dedicated to the big final reveal of our year of work. We soft launched the engine to the public last semester and were met with some major accomplishments. At one point, we were part of the top trending GitHub repos and had reached the top of r/gamedev and r/programming. There was quite a lot of buzz around the D community as well.

We're going to show what we're made of by the end of the year - a bunch of dedicated, talented students with an awesome product to boot. As our engine team finishes the last of the features for Dash, our game team will be working diligently to make sure that we have an awesome game to show off. 

As for me, I'll be making sure that every one is talking about this game by the end of December. Within the next few weeks, our websites will be revamped and better showcase some of the cool content we're making. I'll also try to build up our community through our various media outlets and hopefully some fun dev podcasts. This year will prove to be a lot of work, but it will definitely be a lot of fun.

If you've got any questions or interest in Circular or Dash, feel free to reach out. Next up will be a recap of the start of my hackathon season and an awesome trip down to Penn.

Carl, out
